# tip-calculator

I am building a lightweight tip calculator.

This project is a fronteend mentor challange to design a tip calculator. 

So far, i have been able to figure out the javascript and the HTML, haven't started on the css though. 

Would be updating this as I move along. 

Probably wouldn't use this file because I'd be usingthe ReadMe guide from frontend mentor.
